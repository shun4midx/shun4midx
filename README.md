## Who is Shun?
I don't know either. Hm. Heard he sucks at programming and everything else he loves though. Oh, and he is a sophomore Computer Science student.

You may see me as @shun4midx online, I usually use "shun4mi" or "shun4" for most of my work as a sort of trademark.

Shun4midx is canonically read as "Tsunami Index" or "Shunami Decks", please don't call me "Shun for Midex"!

ÁøîÊµ∑ is pronounced as Shu („Åó„ÇÖ„ÅÜ) in Japanese.

## Languages
English and Japanese are okay! I also am fluent in Mandarin (Traditional Chinese), Cantonese, French, and German, but I may not be as comfortable writing in those languages :)

## Projects
As a habit, I mostly work on private repositories separate from the main repository until they seem to be near production. I'm working on a few projects at the moment, but they all don't feel ready to be published yet, so that's why I seem to be dormant and inactive. I may sometimes decide to toggle them to be public temporarily, and am trying to get more used to having things be public, but I still want to disconnect them from my main work in the non-private-named repositories as much as possible :)
 - I'm currently working on a [Music Theory Tool aimed for Musical Composers](https://github.com/shun4midx/Shun4MIDI-Music-Theory-Tool) (Part 1 of my big Shun4MIDI project) as someone who used to [compose music in high school](https://youtu.be/fNU0zx5wI3Q)
 - I am also supposed to be working on my [personal website](https://github.com/shun4midx/Private-shun4midx-website) (Not my portfolio) but lack the interest in web dev to finish it as of right now
 - I'm also working on [my own Discord bot Shun4miBot](https://github.com/shun4midx/Shun4miBot) coded in [D++ (A C++ library for Discord)](https://dpp.dev/), and plan to make a bot (or a few) for Shun4MIDI too!

## Interests
I love programming, algorithms, listening to music, composing music, and reading upon cool math in my own free time on my own (Although I would be really happy to discuss with others too!). I used to be **really** obsessed over Differential Geometry, but now I find that I gravitate more towards Elliptic Functions and Group Cohomology? I just love math, not really any specific field within it :p

I want to spend more time dedicating my interest towards applied math in CS though! I love pure math but also love applied math, I just never spent enough time learning the latter!
