## Who is Shun?
I don't know either. Hm. Heard he sucks at programming and everything else he loves though. Oh, and he is a sophomore Computer Science student.

You may see me as @shun4midx online, I usually use "shun4mi" or "shun4" for most of my work as a sort of trademark.

Shun4midx is canonically read as "Tsunami Index" or "Shunami Decks", please don't call me "Shun for Midex"!

ÁøîÊµ∑ is pronounced as Shu („Åó„ÇÖ„ÅÜ) in Japanese.

## Languages
English and Japanese are okay! I also am fluent in Mandarin (Traditional Chinese), Cantonese, French, and German, but I may not be as comfortable writing in those languages :)

## Projects
As a habit, I mostly work on private repositories separate from the main repository until they seem to be near production. I'm working on a few projects at the moment, but they all don't feel ready to be published yet, so that's why I seem to be dormant and inactive. I may sometimes decide to toggle them to be active, but I want to disconnect them from my main work as much as possible :)
 - I'm currently working on a <ins><b>Music Theory Tool aimed for Musical Composers</b></ins> (Part 1 of my big Shun4MIDI project) as someone who used to [compose music in high school](https://youtu.be/fNU0zx5wI3Q)
 - I am also supposed to be working on my <ins><b>personal website</b></ins> (Not my portfolio) but lack the interest in web dev to finish it as of right now
 - I'm also working on <ins><b>my own Discord bot Shun4miBot</b></ins> coded in D++ (A C++ library for Discord), and plan to make a bot (or a few) for Shun4MIDI too!

## Interests
I love programming, algorithms, listening to music, composing music, and reading upon cool math. I used to be really obsessed over Differential Geometry, but now I find that I gravitate more towards Elliptic Functions and Group Cohomology? I just love math, not really any specific field within it :p

I want to spend more time dedicating my interest towards applied math in CS though! I love pure math but also love applied math, I just never spent enough time learning the latter!

## Favorite Quote
#### `> "Yasashii Suisei wo Nazotte!"`

I type that everywhere, but it is a combination of my two most favorite YOASOBI songs, "Yasashii Suisei" (Comet) and "Ano Yume wo Nazotte" (Tracing a Dream), and it means "Tracing a Gentle Comet". I guess, it just means, to never give up on your dreams and try to chase them even if they seem impossible to achieve. Afterall, that's the mindset that got me here today :)

## Misc/Favorites
- My favorite programming language is C++ :p
- My favorite numbers are quarternions and aleph null, but my favorite real number is pi.
- My favorite positive integer is [196883 because of the Group Theory monster](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mH0oCDa74tE).
- My favorite natural number is 0 because I love to spite the mathematical community (I believe 0 is a natural number because younger Shun was too obsessed with Peano Axioms for me to not believe so XD).
- My favorite color is blue/cyan, but my favorite color of clothing is black
- My favorite color schemes are gradients from blue to green and blue to pink!
- My favorite artists are YOASOBI and tuki, of course my favorite musical genre is J-Pop.
